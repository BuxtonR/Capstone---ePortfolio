# CS-410: Reverse Engineering Enhancement Project

## Overview
This enhancement was built on the original reverse engineering assignment in CS-410, where I decompiled a binary file and recreated its functionality in C++.

## Original Functionality
The initial project required analyzing assembly output and recreating a simple program with conditional logic and loops. The original code was correct but minimal and lacked extensibility.

## Enhancements
- Added robust input validation and clear prompts for user interaction.
- Included inline comments mapping the C++ logic back to the original assembly to clarify understanding.
- Implemented additional logic pathways for extended behavior based on the original algorithm.
- Enhanced code structure for maintainability and future audits.

## Reflection
This project allowed me to demonstrate binary-to-source conversion skills while practicing clean C++ reconstruction. It built my confidence in working with legacy systems and embedded logic translation.
