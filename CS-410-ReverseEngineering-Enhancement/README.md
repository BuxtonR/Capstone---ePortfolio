# CS-410: Reverse Engineering Enhancement Project

## Overview
This enhancement builds on my original CS-410 reverse engineering assignment, where I decompiled a binary file, analyzed the assembly output, and recreated its functionality in C++.

## Original Functionality
The original code successfully replicated a basic algorithm from a binary, involving conditional logic and loops. However, it lacked documentation, flexibility, and safe input handling.

## Enhancements
- Refactored the C++ code for better structure and clarity.
- Added input validation and detailed user prompts.
- Annotated each section with inline comments mapping logic back to the original assembly.
- Extended program functionality to support a broader input range and more complex logic branches.

## Reflection
This project helped me refine my ability to translate assembly instructions into structured C++ code. It also strengthened my comfort with debugging low-level behavior and applying modern standards to legacy-like codebases.
