# CS-405: Encryption Enhancement Project

## Overview
This enhancement is based on my original work in CS-405, where I developed a C++ application for basic XOR encryption and decryption. For the capstone, I significantly improved the programâ€™s structure, security, and usability to align with modern secure coding practices.

## Original Functionality
The initial version read text files, applied XOR encryption, and wrote the result to output files. However, it lacked error handling, flexible key input, and modular structure, making it difficult to maintain or expand.

## Enhancements
- Separated concerns into modules (encryption logic, file handling, user interface).
- Added key validation and dynamic user input.
- Improved file I/O handling with user prompts and exception safety.
- Implemented logging and clear command-line feedback.
- Followed SEI CERT secure coding standards for memory and input safety.

## Reflection
This project deepened my understanding of secure software design and defensive programming in C++. It reinforced the value of modular architecture, which simplifies testing and makes future improvements more maintainable.
