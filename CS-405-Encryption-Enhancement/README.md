# CS-405: Encryption Enhancement Project

## Overview
This project stems from my work in CS-405, where I originally developed a C++ application for basic XOR encryption and decryption. For the capstone, I significantly enhanced the programâ€™s structure, security, and usability to meet industry-relevant secure coding standards.

## Original Functionality
The initial version focused on reading text files, applying XOR encryption, and saving the output. However, it lacked error handling, encryption key flexibility, and was tightly coupled in design.

## Enhancements
- Modularized the code using a clean separation of concerns (encryption logic, file handling, user interface).
- Added key validation and dynamic key input.
- Improved file I/O with user prompts and exception safety.
- Implemented logging and clearer CLI output for user feedback.
- Followed SEI CERT secure coding standards throughout.

## Reflection
This project reinforced my understanding of C++ file handling, memory safety, and cryptographic basics. It also helped me appreciate how modular design can make security features easier to test and extend.
