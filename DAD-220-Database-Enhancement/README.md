# DAD-220: Database Enhancement Project

## Overview
In DAD-220, I originally created a SQLite relational database to manage retail returns data. For the capstone, I enhanced the data model, queries, and documentation to meet higher standards for scalability and maintainability.

## Original Functionality
The initial schema tracked basic customer, item, and return records. While functional, it lacked normalization, foreign key constraints, and efficient querying structure.

## Enhancements
- Normalized the schema and added relational constraints.
- Introduced foreign key enforcement and meaningful sample data.
- Developed advanced SQL queries using multi-table JOINs.
- Created a portable SQL script with inline documentation.
- Improved clarity through updated documentation and data dictionary.

## Reflection
This project strengthened my ability to design scalable databases and think critically about data integrity, indexing, and query optimization. It emphasized the importance of clarity and planning in backend development.
