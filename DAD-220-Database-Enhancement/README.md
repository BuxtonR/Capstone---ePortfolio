# DAD-220: Database Enhancement Project

## Overview
In DAD-220, I created a relational database using SQLite to manage retail returns data. For the capstone, I enhanced the data model, queries, and documentation for real-world scalability.

## Original Functionality
The original database handled basic customer, item, and return records. The schema was functional but limited in flexibility and indexing.

## Enhancements
- Expanded the schema with new relational constraints and normalized tables.
- Added foreign key enforcement and meaningful sample data for demonstration.
- Developed complex JOIN queries and a SQL script to auto-generate insights.
- Included README documentation for clarity and portability.

## Reflection
This project gave me a deeper appreciation for relational data modeling and efficient querying. I learned to think critically about schema design, scalability, and business logic within SQL.
