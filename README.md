# Buxton McCaslin – Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my Capstone ePortfolio, developed as the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from Southern New Hampshire University. I completed this accelerated degree in under a year and a half with a 4.0 GPA, determined to reenter the national security and technology workforce with a sharp, modernized skill set.

As a U.S. Navy veteran (Cryptologic Technician), I've always been drawn to secure systems, signal intelligence, and mission-critical software. My transition from military service to software development has centered around mastering core engineering principles, secure design patterns, and the tools of modern full-stack development. This portfolio demonstrates those skills across three enhanced artifacts, each showcasing key areas of computer science:

---

## [CS-405: Encryption Application Enhancement](./CS-405-Encryption-Enhancement)

**Focus:** Software Design & Engineering  
Redesigned a C++ application that performs XOR-based encryption, adding improved file I/O support, configurable keys, error handling, and user-friendly output. This project demonstrates secure software design and best practices for defensive programming.

---

## [CS-410: Reverse Engineering Project](./CS-410-ReverseEngineering-Enhancement)

**Focus:** Algorithms & Data Structures  
Refactored and annotated a reverse-engineered binary into C++, improving algorithmic clarity and implementing modern code structure with enhanced comments and safety checks. This artifact highlights my ability to analyze unknown systems and reconstruct logic effectively.

---

## [DAD-220: ReturnsDB Enhancement](./DAD-220-Database-Enhancement)

**Focus:** Databases  
Enhanced a SQLite-based application to support data normalization, reporting, and secure queries. Added structured documentation and an interface to improve database reliability and future scalability. This project demonstrates clean data modeling and backend-focused engineering.

## Career Objective

My goal is to rejoin the defense community as a full-stack developer or systems engineer supporting national security efforts. I'm especially interested in secure systems, embedded software, and advanced R&D initiatives. I'm currently exploring DoD career opportunities and plan to pursue a master’s degree in quantum computing in the future.
